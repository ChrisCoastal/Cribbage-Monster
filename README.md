<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Cribbage Monster is an online version of the classic card game. The app is built with React and uses Firebase Realtime Database for storage and providing updates to clients via websocket.

### Built With

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [React Router 6.4](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)

### Learn

Don't know how to play? Cribbage is a great card game! You can start here with learning the <a href="https://cribbage.netlify.app/rules" target="_blank">Rules of Crib</a>.

## Project

### Inspiration

Cribbage Monster started with the idea of building a small app as a holiday gift for relatives (notably my Dad), so that we can enjoy the family pastime when we aren't together.

### Features

Some highlights from what I wanted to accomplish and include in the project:

- create a multipage app with auth protected routing (React Router and Firebase)
- using Firebase Realtime Database Rules for data validation
- design a UI for gameplay that translates directly from mobile to desktop
- subscribing clients to the database via websocket for multiplayer gameplay
- experimenting with Anime.js for creating svg animations (and menu transitions)
- trying different strategies for conditional styles and animations with Tailwind
- building some basic dashboard components (rather than using VISX, MUI, or etc.)
- checking for dirty / clean disconnects from games
- cleaning up old game data with cloud functions

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

<p align="center">
  <img src='https://github.com/ChrisCoastal/Cribbage-Monster/blob/readme/assets/board-view.jpg' >
</p>

There is still more work and ideas I would love to add (or go back and change üòÖ), but I'm happy with where the project is at in terms of what I set out to make and I look forawrd to moving my focus to other projects.

- [x] block out pages and routing
- [x] Firebase auth
- [x] block out game play UI
- [x] game logic
- [x] read/write game and app context from Firebase backend
- [x] websocket subscription for in game clients
- [x] game cleanup via cloud functions
- [x] flush out UI
- [ ] presence for users in game
- [ ] improve type safety and validation for data from API
- [ ] custom avatar illustrations
- [ ] expand game play options
- [ ] computer opponent(s)
- [ ] ... üèÅ
